I see the shore, I'm on to know
How to embrace the undetow
The vicious thoughts, the taste for blood
Give me break before the flood

It's such a long ride
To get from your dark side
Into the open wide
Riding on a riptide
It's not hard to see
That nobody rides for free
Even the world collides
Riding on a riptide

I lost my life to save my soul
Some broken hearts, some broken bones
Just need a shoal to keep me warm
Take a stride and brave the storm

It's such a long ride
To get from your dark side
Into the open wide
Riding on a riptide
It's not hard to see
That nobody rides for free
Even the world collides
Riding on a riptide

It's such a long ride
To get from your dark side
Into the open wide
Riding on a riptide
It's not hard to see
That nobody rides for free
Even the world collides
Riding on a riptide

Riptide! Riptide!

Riptide!
