[00:09.95] I was scared of dentists and the dark
[00:14.73] I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
[00:19.45] Oh, all my friends are turning green
[00:24.20] You're the magician's assistant in their dream
[00:47.20] 
[00:28.98] Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-ah-ah
[00:36.14] And they come unstuck
[00:46.64] 
[00:39.00] Lady, running down to the riptide
[00:42.53] Taken away to the dark side
[00:44.88] I wanna be your left-hand man
[00:47.91] I love you when you're singing that song
[00:51.46] And I got a lump in my throat
[00:53.85] 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
[01:13.85] 
[00:57.66] There's this movie that I think you'll like
[01:02.02] This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
[01:06.96] This cowboy's running from himself
[01:11.44] And she's been living on the highest shelf
[01:32.44] 
[01:16.52] Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-oh
[01:23.14] And they come unstuck
[01:33.64] 
[01:26.30] Lady, running down to the riptide
[01:29.90] Taken away to the dark side
[01:32.41] I wanna be your left-hand man
[01:35.32] I love you when you're singing that song
[01:38.93] And I got a lump in my throat
[01:41.09] 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
[02:01.09] 
[01:50.08] I just wanna, I just wanna know
[01:54.37] If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
[01:58.85] I just gotta, I just gotta know
[02:03.20] I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
[02:26.20] 
[02:07.63] I swear she's destined for the screen
[02:12.34] Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
[02:42.34] 
[02:17.36] Lady, running down to the riptide
[02:20.99] Taken away to the dark side
[02:23.28] I wanna be your left-hand man
[02:26.40] I love you when you're singing that song
[02:29.89] And I got a lump in my throat
[02:32.06] 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
[02:52.06] 
[02:35.65] Oh lady, running down to the riptide
[02:39.59] Taken away to the dark side
[02:42.00] I wanna be your left-hand man
[02:45.13] I love you when you're singing that song
[02:48.10] And I got a lump in my throat
[02:50.76] 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
[03:10.76] 
[02:54.39] Oh lady, running down to the riptide
[02:58.07] Taken away to the dark side
[03:00.59] I wanna be your left-hand man
[03:03.84] I love you when you're singing that song
[03:07.20] And I got a lump in my throat
[03:09.51] 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
[03:29.51]
